not sure what else can be said about norton products i have used them for years on all my desk and laptop computers easy to install and protects my harddrives well not sure i see what one of the other reviewers stated about upsells from norton havent seen them yet even after almost  weeks of daily use anyway if you are looking for antivirus software that can be easily installed on three of your devices this is for you
save your money and purchase a good ie norton security for your pc too many issues with this version i have not tried the newer editions since i was so burned by this one but i do see where the latest edition is  cheaper than this one so if you are into gambling and want to try the more recent version maybe they got rid of all the bugs and glitches in this one i still would recommend looking elsewhere to protect your pc
i always use norton as my pc security application have for over  years i prefer it to most others as i have never had any issues with worms or viruses of course this  version is now outdated and i would recommend that the intended purchaser go with the  version to be sure to capture all recent updates i now how the  version of this app already purchased and installed on my hp highly recommend the norton as your security application
i found the roxio creator to be too difficult to work with with issues occurring on and off all the time bugs for sure i couldnt get the editing down on this application so i was never able to fully utilize it i did however use it fo video transfers which did seem to work well anyway in looking at the other reviews out here it looks like others have had the same troubles i have had maybe with the  version roxio might get it right but steer clear of the older versions out there
i had a trial version of microsoft office which came with my laptop so i was in the market for the full blown version that would work with my vista system this product was easy to use and install and walked me throught the entire process i would highly recommend to anyone
its a great gamelike it has so many types of dragons amazing
for the amount of money the app is good but the interface leaves a lot to be desired i have it for roku so not sure if its the same on each platform when doing certain things like searching through your shows you have to go through everysingleoneofthem to get to the show you want instead of having each show in its own section like other apps also if you are searching through your shows and you click on it and then go back you go back to the very beginning when looking through recorded shows you scroll through a ton then you can hit see more and again it takes you back to the beginning the show selection is good and i am happy with that part of it but it gets old doing all the scrolling when they could improve the interface and make it a lot easier to see what you have to watch also you cannot always find shows in the search section it is odd and another one of frndlys weird features
cheaper to buy the amazon upgrade versus paining apples high pricebr to be honest i wonder at times why i do this every year the features really arent any better each year i dont have a lot backed up but do have somebr i havent hung a website up so whybr keeps an email available to me my wife and daughter to communicate with yes i have gmail and hotmail but both have been spammed and taken over even w password changesbr so i pay the fee and upgrade thanks to amazon
fun app
